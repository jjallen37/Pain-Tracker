<li><b>Feeling Like You’ve Been Hit by a Mack Truck:</b> What does it feel like to be run over by a Mack truck? Thankfully, actual occurrences are few. When I first developed pain, and long before I heard of fibromyalgia, I used Mack Truck metaphors for my own experience. Having grown up near the company’s headquarters, I may have been quicker than average to make this this association.  Yet, when I was finally diagnosed and began reading about people’s experiences with fibromyalgia and related pain syndromes, I found such references were rampant... <A HREF="http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/pain-tracking/201110/treat-chronic-pain-ongoing-experiment">read more<A></li>

<li><b>The healing effects of intimacy:</b> The most common advice on how to approach sex when you suffer from chronic pain is...carefully. The typical message is that intimacy is challenging and uncomfortable but ultimately worth it for the sake of the relationship. However, this advice neglects evidence that sexual intimacy may reduce pain which means that chronic pain may be more reason, not less, to engage in sensual acts... <A HREF="http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/paintracking/201111/the-healing-powers-sex">read more</A></li>

<li><b>Treat chronic pain as a daily experiment:</b> Chronic pain is often accompanied by a frustrating level of uncertainty and many vexing questions: Why did I have such a great day yesterday, but hurt like the dickens today? Is there a medication or combination of medications that will relieve my symptoms? What about exercise? Can I develop a realistic fitness program that helps? How about other strategies to feel better? What can I do to increase my good days and good moments? In a nutshell, how can I gain greater control over how I feel?... <A HREF="http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/pain-tracking/201110/treat-chronic-pain-ongoing-experiment">read more<A></li>

<li><b>Improving through fitness:</b> A doctor who has fibromyalgia once told me: "You can have weak muscles that hurt, or strong muscles that hurt." This statement made a big impression on me. Although exercise will not cure the pain and exhaustion of fibromyalgia, muscle endurance increases our capabilities. The message in the medical literature is clear: people with fibromyalgia who are physically fit suffer less symptoms. The key question is how we get there. How can we get in shape when it hurts just to get out of bed? The answer, like most aspects of dealing with this condition, is not simple. It requires discipline, faith, and lots of patience. But sticking to a personalized exercise program can really pay off... <A HREF="fms01.html">read more</A></li>

<li><b>Practical Tips:</b> Fibromyalgia presents a daily struggle. Here are some tips--in no particular order--that have made my life easier and even downright fun...<A HREF="fms02.html"> read more</A></li> 
<p></p>
<li><b>&quot;Invisible&quot; Disability:</b>"You look fine...." Such words are usually intended as a compliment. Sometimes they provide reassurance. But they can also produce confused feelings when someone is silently suffering. This problem is not unique to fibromyalgia. Parallels are easily drawn with other conditions with controversial diagnoses and uncertain cause, such as chronic fatigue syndrome, posttraumatic stress disorder, and premenstrual syndrome. These disorders can be considered "invisible" disabilities because they are virtually impossible for casual observers to detect... <A HREF="fms03.html">read more</A></li>

<li><b>Witch or Martyr:</b> One of the greatest challenges of chronic pain is finding ways to live with others. Sometimes it seems more comforting to stay home alone, where we can relax, tend to our aches, set our own pace, and control our total environment. This would free us from having to explain, apologize, look odd, or feel guilty about the things we have difficulty contending with. We would no longer impose our tortured bodies on anybody else... <A HREF="fms04.html">read more</A></li>
<p></p>
<li><b>Maintaining a Positive Attitude:</b> "Have a positive attitude." How many times have we heard that one? While our emotions can not cause fibromyalgia or chronic fatigue syndrome, they no doubt affect our symptoms. But how can we maintain good thoughts when our bodies feel so lousy? This challenge, of course, does not pertain exclusively to chronic illness, but to any time when things do not go as we wish. But in the case of ongoing illness, seeing the positive presents a continuous struggle... <A HREF="fms05.html">read more</A></li>

<li><b>&quot;Nobody Understands&quot;:</b> The other day, during a casual conversation, a friend told how she had explained my condition (fibromyalgia) to someone else: You know, when you work yourself really hard, so that you feel totally exhausted, and you ache from top to bottom so badly that you cannot even get up? Well that's how Debbie feels. Only it does not go away. I was floored. I felt tears flooding my eyes. But why? I wondered. Well, because I was understood. My friend showed me that she knew what I was experiencing, how I go about my day. If she were an anthropologist, she should feel successful because she managed a deep understanding of the "native's experience."... <A HREF="fms07.html">read more</A></li>

<li><b>On Fibromyalgia:</b> Fibromyalgia is a chronic condition characterized primarily by widespread pain throughout the body. The name fibromyalgia, introduced by Muhammad Yunus MD and his colleagues in 1981, literally means pain in the muscles and tissue. "Fibro" refers to the fascia or connective tissue, "my" to muscle, and "algia" to pain. Other ailments associated with fibromyalgia include fatigue, poor quality sleep, difficulty concentrating, sensitivity to light, noise and cold, and irritable bowel... <A HREF="whatisfms.html">read more</A></li>
