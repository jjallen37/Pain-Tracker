<H2><CENTER>What Is Fibromyalgia?</CENTER></H2>

<H4><CENTER><A HREF="fms06.html">Deborah A. Barrett</A></CENTER></H4>

<P>Fibromyalgia is a chronic condition characterized primarily
by widespread pain throughout the body. The name fibromyalgia,
introduced by Muhammad Yunus MD and his colleagues in 1981, literally
means pain in the muscles and tissue. &quot;Fibro&quot; refers
to the fascia or connective tissue, &quot;my&quot; to muscle,
and &quot;algia&quot; to pain. Other ailments associated with
fibromyalgia include fatigue, poor quality sleep, difficulty concentrating,
sensitivity to light, noise and cold, and irritable bowel.</P>

<P>As many as 2% of the general population may suffer from this
condition. No ethnic group seems any more likely to have fibromyalgia;
however women develop it approximately 8 times more often than
do men.</P>

<P>While the medical community does not yet understand the pathology
underlying fibromyalgia, more and more information about this
condition is becoming known. Medical researchers are now actively
searching for the cause, mechanisms and best treatments for fibromyalgia
and related conditions. To keep abreast of scientific studies
on fibromyalgia, you can search and read the abstracts of articles
on <A HREF="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/">MEDLINEplus</A>,
the National Library of Medicine's database of medical journal
articles.</P>

      <P><B>Diagnostic Criteria</B></P>

      <P>In 1990, the diagnosis of fibromyalgia entered the mainstream
      in the United States. The American College of Rheumatology (ACR)
      put forward official criteria to recognize this condition:</P>

      <OL>
        <LI>widespread pain for at least three months in three quadrants
        of the body, and
        <LI>abnormal sensitivity to palpation in at least 11 of 18 specific
        tender points (as depicted in the illustration).
      </OL>

      <P>These diagnostic criteria provide an important empirical basis
      to diagnose fibromyalgia. During a physical exam, a physician
      presses lightly (just until the fingernail whitens) on specific
      tender points as well as control spots and evaluates the patient's
      response. People affected by fibromyalgia may not realize they
      have tender points until someone familiar with the condition
      applies pressure to them. Wincing, jumping, or any other visible
      or vocal response of pain depicts excessive tenderness. It has
      been the case that people with fibromyalgia see an average of
      five physicians before receiving the proper diagnosis, but as
      physicians become more familiar with the tender point exam, diagnoses
      are made more quickly. The number of tender points that elicit
      pain can vary and someone with widespread pain but only nine
      or ten tender points should not be ruled out. The diagnosis of
      fibromyalgia relies not only on tender points, but on a thorough
      medical history and appropriate lab tests to rule out alternative
      diagnoses.

<P>Fibromyalgia is not a new syndrome; evidence for its existence
dates back centuries. Until recently, however, the cluster of
symptoms that comprise fibromyalgia, or fibrositis one of its
former names, were largely considered psychogenic. It is the case
that doctors who lack a physiological explanation for symptoms
are prone to attribute complaints to mental problems or malingering.
This has been the case for fibromyalgia because it lacks a clear
test to verify its existence, its sufferers &quot;look fine,&quot;
and are predominantly female, a group less likely believed. This
skepticism began to change in the late 1970s and early 1980s when
more research became available about sleep abnormalities and reproducible
tender spots in fibromyalgia. An important group of rheumatologists
(the specialty of physicians that treat arthritis) realized that
this group of patients did not fit the profile of hypochondriacs.
Rheumatologists started to pay more serious attention to the suffering
described by these patients, who continue to make up 20% of a
rheumatologist's practice.</P>

<P>The ACR diagnostic criteria for fibromyalgia came about following
an extensive study by 25 medical researchers of more than 500
patients in 16 North American studies. Blinded researchers investigated
over 300 different factors in patients with various pain complaints.
From this study, they concluded that the most reliable predictors
of fibromyalgia are the prevalence of tender points and widespread
pain (<A HREF="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=PubMed&amp;list_uids=2607511&dopt=Abstract">Wolfe
et al., 1989</A>).</P>

<P>In the early 1990s, the World Health Organization declared
fibromyalgia a significant medical problem and included it in
its 10th International Classification of Disease (ICD-10).</P>

<P>Yet &quot;non-believers&quot; still exist. It may be the case
that for some doctors, fibromyalgia will not be considered 'real'
until its cause and cure are discovered. Fortunately these are
becoming fewer and farther between. International conferences
of experts now meet regularly to share their findings. Publications
on fibromyalgia have increased tremendously, bringing us closer
to a fuller understanding of this condition. While rheumatologists
were the first to treat fibromyalgia, family physicians are becoming
more adept at diagnosing and treating this condition. Doctors
of physical medicine, or physiatrists, often specialize in the
treatment of fibromyalgia and other pain disorders.</P>

<H4>Medical Theories</H4>

<P>'Fibromyalgia' is a descriptive name that may change as we
learn more about the condition. It could be the case that various
different illnesses with similar symptoms are now being included
under the rubric of fibromyalgia, or that fibromyalgia is part
of a larger family of pain amplification disorders such as migraines
or temporomandibular joint (TMJ).</P>

<P>Numerous theories, supported by empirical findings, try to
account for what has gone awry in the fibromyalgia body. The simplest
explanation is that as with many other conditions such as allergies,
heart disease, diabetes, or cancer, a genetic predisposition makes
some people more susceptible than others. Fibromyalgia develops
when a 'triggering incident' throws the body's system off track.
This could be a virus, physical or emotional trauma, repetitive
stress, sleep deprivation, or some combination of these. (A small
proportion of people seem to be born with fibromyalgia). Exactly
what changes in a fibromyalgia body to cause pain and fatigue
is not fully understood. The most recent scientific theories consider
the pathology to be located in the central nervous system, where
pain signals may be amplified or improperly filtered, causing
otherwise innocuous stimuli elicit in severe pain. Researchers
have found that people with fibromyalgia have elevated amounts
of the neurotransmitters that signal pain responses (Substance
P), as well as depressed levels of natural pain killers (serotonin)
and hormones that restore muscle regeneration (growth hormone).
Other findings include abnormal sleep patterns, mainly a decrease
in slow-wave deep-levels of sleep that are most restful to the
muscles. These all represent important pieces of the puzzle.</P>

<H4>Treatments for Fibromyalgia</H4>

<P>The good news about fibromyalgia is that there does not seem
to be any underlying pathology that worsens. Treatments therefore
focus on alleviating symptoms of pain and sleeplessness. The difficulties
of fibromyalgia tend to cycle. When pain is severe, it interferes
with sleep, which worsens pain, mood, cognitive ability, and so
on. Treatments aim to break this cycle and reverse its direction.
In other words, when reducing pain, allows sleep to become easier,
which further reduces pain and fatigue, and so on.</P>

<P>The treatments for fibromyalgia sound easy in that they all
read like basic practices for good health and well being. They
include: (1) a carefully planned exercise program that includes
gentle stretching and gradual progression toward aerobic conditioning;
and (2) drug therapy, primarily to improve sleep. Physical therapy
may be helpful and could include such techniques as heat, ice,
massage, whirlpool, and electrical stimulation to help control
pain. Some patients benefit from medication for pain relief. However,
whatever is wrong with the fibromyalgia body makes things like
exercise and sleep a challenge. Nonetheless, with much patience
and a good understanding of one's body's reactions, people with
this condition can improve how they feel.</P>

<P><B>Exercise</B> may sound to others like an easy antidote.
However, when you are in pain, exercise is not easy. Furthermore,
people with fibromyalgia do not respond to exercise like other
people and need to approach it gradually. But if approached appropriately
and gradually, exercise can provide natural painkillers, improve
strength, endurance, and fitness. A regular exercise program can
decrease pain and improve overall well being, sleep quality, and
daily stamina. <A HREF="fms01.html">See my article on exercise</A>.</P>

<P><B>Good quality sleep</B> is a bedrock of fibromyalgia treatment.
Studies have shown that sleep deprivation can induce fibromyalgia-like
symptoms. Many people with fibromyalgia suffer from sleep abnormalities
and often awake feeling as if they had not slept at all. This
is called nonrestorative sleep. There are many different medicines
that can improve sleep quality. It may take several tries to find
the ones that work best for each individual. The recommended approach
is to begin with small doses of medicine to see how they are tolerated,
then increase as needed. The goal is to improve sleep without
introducing unpleasant side effects. Talk with your doctor about
how each medicine works and the expected duration of any side
effects. Bedtime routines are also very important for improving
sleep. Wind down your day with something soothing such as a hot
bath. Try to organize your days to allow yourself the best possible
rest. Limit daytime naps. Exercise improves sleep quality, but
it is best not to exercise directly before sleep. Make sure your
mattress and pillow(s) provide appropriate support and cushion.
Earplugs can be very helpful to block disturbing noise. Adjust
your sleep environment such as the temperature, humidity, and
darkness to your preference. Create a relaxing bedtime ritual
and aim for a solid eight hours. Click here for the <A HREF="http://www.mayohealth.org:80/mayo/9904/htm/fibromyla.htm">Mayo

<P><B>Pain relief</B> is essential. Understanding what helps you
through paintracking allows you to amass strategies to prevent
and relieve pain. Heat in various forms soothes aching muscles
as does gentle stretching. Earplugs, lightweight but warm clothing
(such as silks and polar fleece) and sunglasses can ward off flares
from noise, cold drafts, or bright lighting. Meditation, hypnotherapy
and self-hypnosis, biofeedback, and diaphragmatic breathing exercises
all offer ways to lower the thermostat on pain. For some, massage
therapy works wonders. Pain medications help people to feel well
enough to do the other things necessary to improve and live a
fuller life. Some doctors prescribe pain medications to be taken
proactively. The analgesic effects of medications are more effective
before pain escalates. Discuss with your doctor short versus longer
acting medications. For some, over-the-counter medications may
be adequate. For others, stronger medications such as narcotics
are needed. Some physicians are reluctant to prescribe narcotics
for long-term use, a bias that stems from a fear of addiction.
Yet evidence shows that people in pain do not abuse painkillers--we
desire to engage in life, not escape it. There is an important
distinction between physical dependence and addiction. It is important
to keep track of how you take any medication to monitor its effectiveness.
Slowly our society is realizing the need for more comprehensive
treatments for chronic pain in conditions that are not fatal.</P>

<P><B>Pacing</B> becomes a very important aspect of living well
with fibromyalgia. You may find that taking a break every few
hours will allow you to gain a second wind, and maybe even a third
or forth. By tracking how you feel and your activity levels, you
can learn how to organize your day and weeks to make the most
of the energy you have. Creative scheduling can allow people with
fibromyalgia to engage in a full life. Knowing when you need to
rest and when you can push on make this condition much more manageable.</P>
