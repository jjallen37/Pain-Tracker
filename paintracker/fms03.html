<H2><CENTER>&quot;Invisible&quot; Disability</CENTER></H2>

<P>&quot;You look fine....&quot; Such words are usually intended
as a compliment. Sometimes they provide reassurance. But they
can also produce confused feelings when someone is silently suffering.
This problem is not unique to fibromyalgia. Parallels are easily
drawn with other conditions with controversial diagnoses and uncertain
cause, such as chronic fatigue syndrome, posttraumatic stress
disorder, and premenstrual syndrome. These disorders can be considered
&quot;invisible&quot; disabilities because they are virtually
impossible for casual observers to detect.</P>

<P>What does it mean to contend with a seemingly invisible medical
condition? It does not always work against us, for we can &quot;pass
for normal&quot; when we want to. At other times, however, it
might be helpful to have a large sign on our forehead saying &quot;PAIN&quot;
or some such thing.</P>

<P>In what follows, I address why fibromyalgia has been nicknamed
the invisible disability and how this has been changing. I also
discuss issues relevant to having an invisible disability. For
those of us suffering with pain and fatigue, it feels anything
but invisible. What I propose are ways to make our experience
more visible, in a sense, so that we can better confront it. Unlike
illnesses with 'objective' measures and agreed-upon treatment
programs, with fibromyalgia, we are the ones best able to detect
the vagaries of our condition. It is therefore up to us to discover
ways to understand and improve our situation. As we become more
versed in the determinants of our symptoms, the seemingly invisible
quality of our condition can work to our advantage. Ideally it
becomes our decision when and how to make our experience visible
and when to keep it invisible.</P>

<H4>The Visibility of Fibromyalgia</H4>

<P>The visibility of fibromyalgia is no doubt increasing. Those
who developed fibromyalgia more recently are much &quot;luckier&quot;
than those who had to bite the bullet for years while being told
they were perfectly healthy. Fibromyalgia is now understood to
be the most common cause of chronic musculoskeletal pain. Sources
estimate between 3 and 26 million Americans suffer from this condition.
One of the most significant contributions to this change was the
creation of diagnostic criteria by the American College of Rheumatology
in 1990. The official diagnostic criteria rest on a examination
by a knowledgeable physician of &quot;tender&quot; points throughout
the body. Although the criteria are subjective, they are quantifiable;
the diagnosis is made when the patient responds to moderate palpation
at a minimum of 11 of the 18 sites. Although some physicians remain
inexperienced and reluctant to examine tender points, and some
(including rheumatologists) refuse to accept that the bundle of
symptoms constitutes a real disease entity, a growing number of
physicians recognize and treat fibromyalgia. In addition, an international
declaration in 1992 signed by medical experts from around the
globe and endorsed by the World Health Organization decreed that
fibromyalgia is &quot;indeed a true medical problem.&quot;</P>

<P>Those of us with fibromyalgia might find such declaration silly:
Of course we have a problem -- we know it is not normal to hurt
from head to toe, day after day. But the official recognition
of fibromyalgia has had a tremendous impact on the legitimacy
and therefore the visibility of our condition. For the individual
with fibromyalgia, the first step in making her experience visible
is proper diagnosis by a physician. The diagnosis not only rules
out other conditions, it opens up the gates to treatment. Being
diagnosed with fibromyalgia initiates us into a sort of club.
We soon become familiar with a new vocabulary -- tricyclics, trigger-point
injections, benzodiazepines, 1-10 pain scales -- that become part
of how we talk and even think about our own experience.</P>

<P>Unfortunately, it is still not unusual for people to see numerous
specialists and undergo many expensive tests before acquiring
the correct diagnosis. The search for a name for one's suffering
can be quite depressing and can lead one to question his own sanity.
As fibromyalgia and its symptoms are becoming more widely recognized,
however, diagnoses are being made more quickly. With the diagnosis
of fibromyalgia, our pain and fatigue become associated with a
legitimate disability. This, in turn, enables us to pursue avenues
available to those with more &quot;visible&quot; disabilities,
such as handicap parking permits and Social Security disability
payments. In 1999, the US Social Security Administration included
fibromyalgia in its list of disabling conditions. This does not
mean that everyone with fibromyalgia would be determined to be
&quot;disabled,&quot; however if you are disabled by problems
of fibromyalgia you no longer receive a label such as &quot;adjustment
disorder&quot; to gain coverage.</P>

<P>How invisible is fibromyalgia? Well, it is certainly visible
in bookstores and libraries, and on the Internet! Over the last
decade, dozens of self-help books have been published on fibromyalgia,
and information sites and discussion groups span the Internet.
In addition, fibromyalgia has now been discussed on mainstream
television programs. Support groups have arisen across the country,
providing information to patients and practitioners, and networking
with health organizations, hospitals, and universities. While
'knowledge is power', the abundance of information pertaining
to fibromyalgia can also be confusing. The treatment options being
touted range from acupuncture, blue-green algae, biofeedback,
dietary regimes, cough expectorant, hormone therapy, hypnosis,
and trigger-point injections to a long list of pharmaceutical
drugs. As there is little expert consensus on &quot;what works,&quot;
it remains challenging for even the best-intentioned reader to
develop an ideal treatment program.</P>

<H4>The Invisibility of Fibromyalgia</H4>

<P>Why did fibromyalgia remain invisible for so long? One contributing
factor is the fact that 80% to 95% of fibromyalgia sufferers are
women. Like other conditions predominantly acquired by women,
its symptoms have often been attributed to hypochondria. In the
1950s and 1960s in the United States, fibromyalgia was often considered
a &quot;manifestation of psychogenic rheumatism&quot; and patients
were considered hysterical. Until recently, many physicians classified
people who complained of the pain and fatigue as malingerers.
Even with growing evidence of the physical reality of fibromyalgia,
the gendered nature and virtual invisibility of this condition
can result in insensitive and (at worst) nontherapeutic doctor-patient
relations. The gendered nature of fibromyalgia can also negatively
impact men. As fibromyalgia is defined as a &quot;women's condition,&quot;
men with symptoms confront separate issues of credibility. Not
only may men be overlooked as candidates for the diagnosis (as
with breast cancer or eating disorders), they face the additional
difficulty of contending with weak, painful muscles in light of
masculine ideals of strength and independence.</P>

<P>Even some mainstream medical journals indicate that physicians
are not enthusiastic about treating fibromyalgia. There are no
laboratory tests to confirm the diagnosis, no understanding of
the underlying cause, and no accepted therapeutic regimen to &quot;cure&quot;
our condition. Clinical researchers complain that fibromyalgia
treatment outcomes are difficult to evaluate because they lack
&quot;objective&quot; findings. Furthermore, physicians are often
frustrated by our multiple complaints and poor prognosis. Medical
articles refer to fibromyalgia patients as &quot;challenging&quot;
at best, and as &quot;difficult&quot; and &quot;extremely draining.&quot;
Traditional medical models best apply to those who conform to
the &quot;sick role,&quot; that is, patients who temporarily discontinue
their usual roles and resume them when they improve. We, on the
other hand, must be motivated to maintain and meet normal social
responsibilities, while contending with fairly constant physical
problems. This makes it even more imperative to focus on ways
to make our symptoms visible to ourselves so that we can react
accordingly.</P>

<H4>Making Fibromyalgia Visible</H4>

<P>Because the symptoms of fibromyalgia are obvious (quite obvious!)
to those of us suffering from them, it is we who must render them
visible by recording them. Only we with fibromyalgia are in the
position to understand how changes in weather, activity, stress,
and treatment programs influence how we feel. We know when we
are a few steps away from &quot;hitting the wall.&quot; By devising
a personalized record-keeping system, we can discern how various
factors affect our pain, energy level, and general mood. While
the medical profession remains unclear about what constitutes
the best regime for the fibromyalgia population as a whole, individual
patients can determine what works for them by recording and analyzing
their own data. We must don the hat of scientist and devise an
optimal program. Just like the diabetic who learns self management
by taking blood sugars and regulating her insulin, or the asthmatic
who measures his respiratory ability and self-medicates accordingly
(and knows when to call the doctor), we can find ways to measure
and regulate our activities. While we may not have the &quot;benefit&quot;
of blood sugar level measurements, our symptoms remain visible
to us at all times.</P>

<P>Making pain visible does not have to rely on words. Sometimes
writing about illness puts too much emphasis on the very things
we want to ignore. Drawing pictures offers an alternative way
to capture our daily experiences. Pictures can be simple or quite
creative and elaborate: they could represent not only your mood,
but also contain symbols for relevant factors such as weather
conditions, medications, and daily activities or stresses. Trends
that would have been lost on our daily memories could be detected
in the overtime changes in visual representations.</P>

<P>The more visible our experience, the better able we are to
educate our physicians. Most of us take several prescription drugs
and have tried countless others. The optimal program must be determined
by trial and error. There are no better evaluative data than systematic
records of our own experience.</P>

<P>In every interaction, we face choices about the extent to which
we want to make fibromyalgia visible. Too much disclosure can
generate fear, unwanted pity, and even discrimination. But hiding
fibromyalgia completely may create unrealistic expectations that
may be difficult and unhealthful to live up to. Ideally, visibility
should be provided on a need-to-know basis. In general, people
calculate where and how they want to spend their money and time.
In the same fashion, we decide how to allocate our precious energy
and pain -- whether, for example, we choose to shake hands with
someone or offer an explanation (true or fabricated) to avoid
it. This is a very individual decision. But the bottom line in
this issue of 'visibility' is control, taking one's body into
one's own hands -- which is the hallmark of the women's health
movement and of self-help groups. The importance of control is
also echoed in the fibromyalgia medical literature. A recent study
found that &quot;self efficacy&quot; (the belief that one can
competently cope with a challenging situation) was found to be
the best predictor of improvement in fibromyalgia.</P>
