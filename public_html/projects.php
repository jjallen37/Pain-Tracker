<!-- Overview -->
	 <h2>Process</h2>
	 <p>
	    There are written descriptions of the projects and clients will be
	    presenting their projects in class on Monday, August 27.
	    In the first day's class we will attempt to make a first cut so that you can
	    have more time hearing about the projects of most interest.

	 </p> 
	 <p>
	    You are to turn in your preferences for a project electronically by
	    <b>8 p.m.</b> on <b>Monday, August 27</b>.
	    You are to fill in your prioritized preferences on the provided
	    Google spreadsheet.
	    Last name is sufficient.
	    You should only enter integers in any other columns.
	    You may give me ties if you have multiple projects that are of equal
	    interest to you.
	    Please give me all projects that you are interested in.
	    Do not give me projects that you do not want to do.
	    If you have a team that wants to work together, you are to
	    submit a <i>single</i> set of preferences.
	    Simply put all of the names in the name column.
	 </p> 
	 <p>
	    I will post assignments on the web site early Tuesday morning.
	    Look for them around 8 am.
	 </p> 
	 <p>
	    Once teams are assigned, I need to schedule weekly team meetings.
	    I will do this on a team basis.
	    If your team has limited options, the sooner you give me the information
	    the better.
	    My (strongly) preferred hours are 8 am - 6 pm Monday - Friday.
	    I teach other classes 9:30-10:45 and 3:30-4:45 Tuesday and Thursday and there
	    is a weekly faculty and committee meetings on Friday 12-2:30;
	    those times are therefore not available.
	    Please post possible times on the
	    Meeting Times Google spreadsheet.
