	 <h2><a name="top">Evaluation</a></h2>
	 <p>
	    Each student is to email their evaluations to me by 4 pm on Tuesday,
	    December 13.
	    Evaluations can be in the form of a document or an email.
	    These are confidential evaluations and will not be shared with
	    your team mates.
	    Evaluations are not optional.
	    I WILL assign an INCOMPLETE to anyone not turning in an evaluation.
	    Once they are past due, I will send incessant bug notes;
	    I do not really want to give incompletes.
	 </p>
	 <p>
	    The evaluation is to include the following:
	    <ol>
	       <li>
		  Overall team evaluation.
		  How did the team work as a whole?
		  What worked well and what didn't?
		  How was the work divided?
		  Did the division work well?
	       </li>
	       <li>
		  Individual assessments of each team member, including yourself.
		  The assessment should cover
		  <ul class="nobullet">
		     <li>technical ability</li>
		     <li>technical contribution</li>
		     <li>organizational skill</li>
		     <li>team participation</>
		  </ul>
		  This should include both a narrative and numeric evaluation.
		  You are to assign a numeric value between 1 and 5 to each
		  individual on each of these
		  four categories.
		  (1 is worst and 5 is best.)
		  The narrative should justify the ranking and address
		  the following points:
		  <ul class="nobullet">
		     <li>
			Describe what tasks were assigned to the person and
			how they executed those assignments.
		     </li>
		     <li>
			Did they help others?
		     </li>
		     <li>
			Did they contribute?
		     </li>
		     <li>
			Did they need a lot of guidance or were they self-starting?
		     </li>
		  </ul>
		  Finally, you are to allocate $10,000 across the team.
		  You must allocate all of the money.
	       </li>
	       <li>
		  Project and client evaluation.
		  Was the project appropriate for the course?
		  Was it too large or too small?
		  Was the client available?
		  Helpful?
		  Positive?
		  This is to be narrative only.
	       </li>
	    </ol>
