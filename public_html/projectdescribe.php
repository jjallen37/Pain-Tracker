            <h1>Web Site</h1>
            <p>
                The web site is to be the repository of all project materials.
                While you may use it to keep track of early drafts of documents,
                it is only necessary to keep the latest, most current version.
            </p>
            <p>
                You may build your own web site 
                or use any existing tools.
                I strongly recommend using an existing tool and infrastructure.
                Why?
                You have plenty of work to do and don't really need to build a web site.
                Tools that have been used for the web site include
                <ul>
                    <li><a href="https://sites.google.com/">Google</a></li>
                    <li><a href="http://www.wikispaces.com">wikispaces</a></li>
                    <li><a href="http://web.unc.edu/">Wordpress (managed by the university)</a></li>
                    <li><a href="http://wordpress.com/">Wordpress (external)</a></li>
                    <li><a href="http://www.assembla.com/">assembla</a></li>
                    <li><a href="http://sourceforge.net/">sourceforge</a></li>
                </ul>
                Any site is fine.
                You should consult with your client to assure that is alright for them.
                (They may have a site that they want you to use or be concerned about
                public availability.)
                You simply need to identify the url.
                If you are using a system that requires login to post to,
                the professor must be a registered user.
                It is the simplest way to give you feedback and assures that I have
                appropriate access.
            </p>
            <p>
                For most of you, this will be a public website and you need to be considerate of such use.
                If there are confidentiality issues
                with a client or subjects, they need to be honored on this site.
                The contents and appearance of the web site reflect on your team, on the
                class, and on the university.
                Do not post anything that you do not want the world to see.
                This is also the place that you can share design,
                code, and techniques with other teams.
                This is a living document and needs to be kept up to date.
                Feel free to put anything out on the web site that helps the team.
                Specific elements required on the web site are as follows.
                They are listed in the approximate order that they will be added.
                <b>The first 3 items and the behavioral team rules are to be posted
                when the site is established.</b>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <b>Team Roles</b>.
                        Identify your client manager, project manager, editor and chief developer.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Contact Information</b>.
                        Include your team, your client, and any consultants.
                        If possible, you should include one click email to the development team;
                        this is a convenience, but not required
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Schedule of Regular Meetings</b>.
                        Include meetings with professor, client, and team meetings.

                    <li>
                        <b>Journal of Meetings and Decisions</b>.
                        This is the place to capture decisions that have been made and
                        discussions that have been had.
                        Capturing the information will help
                        assure consistent understandings and (hopefully) reduce the number of
                        times the same point will be rediscussed.
                    </li>
                   <li>
                        <b>Related Links</b>.
                        These are any useful external resources that the team may need.
                        They may include links to similar projects that you can learn from,
                        domain-specific content that will frequently be referenced, and
                        pointers to the technology that is being used.
                        For example, if you find good publicly available tutorials for technologies,
                        this is a good place to maintain those links.
                        <b>Please do NOT post any links to materials that have questionable IP rights.</b>

                        <b>Project Description</b>.
                        This is a high level description that introduces the casual observer to the project.
                        A visitor to your website should be able to
                        read this description or and understand what you are doing and why.
                        Treat it as a "sales pitch".
                        You want to excite the reader and make him want to learn more about the project.

                        <a name="User_Stories"></a><b>User stories</b>.
                        User stories are 2-3
                        sentence descriptions of the tasks that different users will want to accomplish.
                        They should be short enough to fit on an index card
                        and should be written from the perspective of a user.
                        The key aspect of the user story is that it should be the way that the
                        client thinks of the problem.
