<H2><CENTER>Maintaining a Positive Attitude</CENTER></H2>

<P>&quot;Have a positive attitude.&quot; How many times have we
heard that one? While our emotions can not cause fibromyalgia
or chronic fatigue syndrome, they no doubt affect our symptoms.
But how can we maintain good thoughts when our bodies feel so
lousy? This challenge, of course, does not pertain exclusively
to chronic illness, but to any time when things do not go as we
wish. But in the case of ongoing illness, seeing the positive
presents a continuous struggle.</P>

<P>Yet our moods are not perfectly correlated with our physical
state. Most likely we can all recall times that despite much pain
or fatigue, we were able to cope and even achieve high spirits.
Perhaps the weather was perfect, good friends visited, we just
accomplished something or helped somebody, making us feel good
about ourselves. Other times, depression seems to take hold even
when our physical discomfort is at a manageable level. Why is
this? Answering this question is the key to finding optimism.</P>

<P>To me, the vicissitudes of fibromyalgia feel like a swim in
the turbulent sea -- sometimes it seems we have fallen and the
waves continue to crash on our heads, as we fight to rise, only
to be knocked down yet again. But that same ocean sometimes allows
us to find a wave we can ride smoothly to the shore.</P>

<P>What can we do when we feel under the waves? How can we find
the strength to climb back on top, and the patience to know that
we will? Here are ten cognitive exercises I use to maintain the
most positive attitude I can:</P>

<P><B>1. Expect bumps!</B> It is important to acknowledge that
we will sometimes feel down. Who wouldn't in our condition? But
by expecting rather than dreading down time, such periods become
more tolerable. In addition, recognizing that we will have blue
periods helps keep them in perspective. We will be able to say
to ourselves, &quot;I was depressed before, and got out of it;
this time, too, it will pass.&quot; It is easy to forget that
before our illness, there were times we felt down. Now these periods
are wrapped up in our medical problems; but everyone gets depressed
some of the time. After accepting that we will sometimes feel
sad, and even experience self pity, we can concentrate on ways
to shorten these periods and make them fewer and farther between.</P>

<P><B>2. Track the changes. </B>Keeping track of moods helps put
ups and downs into perspective. During your best times, make a
conscious attempt to capture the feeling. Leave notes on your
wall attesting to the way you feel. Living with chronic illness
easily creates a Jekyll-and-Hyde persona, where your optimistic
self and your flare-up self are not sufficiently acquainted. When
we feel bad, it becomes quite difficult to imagine that things
can be otherwise. Similarly, during times of improvement, it's
amazing how quickly we may forget how bad a previous period was,
making subsequent flare-ups not only intolerable but shocking.
Counting and measuring the duration of the bad times -- as well
as the good ones -- can put them into perspective. It may be that
over time, our worst occurs about once a month, although it feels
much more frequent. This knowledge is empowering, because we can
remind ourselves that a bad flare is, for example, our monthly
temporary setback, and find ways to ride it out until our baseline
returns.</P>

<P><B>3. Stockpile fun distractions.</B> We all need to keep lists
handy of the things that make us happy. One of the cruelties of
our condition is that when we need distractions most, we are least
equipped to seek them out. For this reason it is important to
compile a list of our favorite activities when we are feeling
optimistic to be used when we most need them. People with fibromyalgia
often describe how even their worst pain can be put on a back
burner, so to speak, when they become engrossed in an activity.
This is not only a psychological but a physiological response:
our brains can only process so much input at once. When we are
engrossed in a beautiful movie, talking to a good friend on the
phone, or listening to our favorite music while lying on a heating
pad or in the bathtub, we can trick our pain receptors into leaving
us alone! Meanwhile improvements in spirit have an added impact
on our entire well-being. Laughter is good medicine; while dwelling
on our troubles tends to compound them.</P>

<P><B>4. Shape your perspective.</B> Is the glass half empty or
half full? Perspective determines, quite literally, how we view
the world. Having a chronic illness creates an ambiguous construction
of reality for us. Am I, for example, a successful cripple or
an unsuccessful professional? In American culture, much emphasis
is placed on independence, individualism, and achievement. Through
this lens, developing a condition that makes us feel more dependent
and less productive is likely to be a huge disappointment. Yet
as we get older, it becomes more likely that we, or somebody close
to us, will experience debilitating problems. People are often
forced to adapt to sudden, new conditions by adopting a perspective
that accommodates change. Our perspectives are shaped by the comparisons
we make and the expectations they create. Consider, for example,
the immigrant who had been practicing medicine in his home country,
but flees to the US to escape a repressive political regime. Here
he works as a janitor; after years of medical study, he has lost
a prestigious and rewarding occupation. Yet he is thankful for
the opportunity to work and wakes each day driven by hope, perhaps,
of a better future for his children. Yet his difficulties are
also quite apparent. What keeps his spirits up and makes him thankful
rather than bitter? His perspective.</P>

<P><B>5. Create a new self.</B> If we hang on tightly to the &quot;old
self&quot; we were, finding the value of our &quot;new self&quot;
becomes increasingly difficult. (We may even exaggerate how fit
that person was: &quot;I didn't need any sleep, I never felt bad,
I could do anything!&quot;). This does not mean we should totally
discard our previous conception of self; rather, we need to find
a way to integrate the two. In other words, we should seek to
find in our new bodies new ways to enjoy and experience the things
that we had done before. Consider all the aspects of yourself
that you like, and the things that you most want to do; then step
by step, find ways to achieve as many of these as you can. At
the same time, recognize that our expectations must shift so that
we can once again meet them.</P>

<P><B>6. Don't forget the good stuff.</B> While the physical symptoms
of fibromyalgia can feel all-encompassing, there are other parts
of our life--our social relationships, passions, family -- that
also exist. By focusing on the positive aspects of our life, we
become more aware of how many there are: the friends that stuck
by us, the things we still enjoy, and the accomplishments we have
been able to make, however small, under very different conditions.
Because each task now represents a challenge, we should celebrate
whatever we manage to accomplish. As we have been told many times,
if we shorten the list and pace ourselves whatever we do eventually
adds up to something to be very proud of.</P>

<P><B>7. &quot;Oy, it could be worse.&quot;</B> (The Jewish mantra).
As comparisons shape our view, it is helpful to find comparisons
that will provide a fuller appreciation for what has befallen
us. OK, the &quot;eat because children are starving in (fill in
the developing country)&quot; did not work for you as a child.
But try to think of it this way: Many bad things happen in the
world. The odds are that some of them will happen to us. Not because
of anything that we have done, but because, as the saying goes,
shit happens. It takes only a short view of the evening news to
remind ourselves of the horrors occurring every day. So, this
is what has happened to us. We too were caught. Let us examine
what we have: (a) We know our condition is not terminal, so we
need not begin contemplating our pending mortality. (b) As bad
as we sometimes feel, our underlying condition is not going to
get worse. We have already experienced the worst, and, to our
credit, have gotten through it. (c) Although few people achieve
permanent remission, many improve significantly. As we understand
how our actions and emotions influence our general well-being,
we can find ways to partake in more and more activities.</P>

<P><B>8. Keep the hope alive!</B> There is so much room for hope.
It has only been since the 1990s that our condition has acquired
any legitimacy from the medical community. We are in a far better
position than the generations before us who suffered without ever
receiving validation. We know much more about the important roles
of exercise, medication, stretching, pacing and meditation to
bring relief and a sense of control. Furthermore, as medical research
increases, it is only a matter of time before better therapies
(and perhaps even a cure!) are introduced.</P>

<P><B>9. Lean on me!</B> A single most important predictor of
how we do is the support network we create. We certainly appreciate
what it means when someone helps us when we feel especially lousy.
Make sure that, within your means, you continue to be a good friend
to those you care about. We still have lots to give. During a
good moment, write to a friend that you are thinking about her.
Help your family and friends find ways to maintain their relationship
with you. Invite them to your place to eliminate traveling (and
do not worry what your place looks like! They came to see you,
not your housecleaning abilities). Try to be open with family
members, while at the same time supportive of their needs. Put
yourself in their shoes as often as possible -- it can be scary
to have someone you love be sick! Also make sure to seek help
outside of your immediate circle so as not to drain your closest
friends and family. There are now all sorts of support groups,
both live and in virtual computer space.</P>

<P><B>10. Indulge whenever you can.</B> We have lots of time to
focus on our thoughts. Most people do not have the luxury of taking
time to relax and think. OK, we did not ask for these &quot;time
outs.&quot; They are demanded by the needs of our bodies. Nevertheless,
we have control over how we use this extra time. Instead of dwelling
on what our bodies are not doing, give your fantasy full liberty.
Turn these rest periods around to be indulgent time. In our mental
playground, we can practice dance steps we used to know (for there
will be some times we can dance!). We can use the time to think
through problems we face and how we want to spend time when we
are feeling ready, or we can analyze a movie we recently saw,
say prayers, or mentally write a letter to a friend. The article
you are now reading is a product of a spell in the middle of the
night, when I lay in bed, unable to sleep. After taking steps
to make myself more comfortable, I decided to think about what
I would write next. I figured that if I fell asleep, great! But
if not, I'd have thought through my next article. It was about
this point when I, satisfied, went off to dreamland.</P>
