<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>&quot;Nobody Understands!&quot;</H2>

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER><A HREF="fms06.html">Deborah A. Barrett</A></H4>

<P>The other day, during a casual conversation, a friend told how she had
explained my condition (fibromyalgia) to someone else:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>You know, when you work yourself really hard, so that you feel totally
  exhausted, and you ache from top to bottom so badly that you cannot even
  get up? Well that's how Debbie feels. Only it does not go away.</P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>I was floored. I felt tears flooding my eyes. But why? I wondered. Well,
because I was understood. My friend showed me that she knew what I was experiencing,
how I go about my day. If she were an anthropologist, she should feel successful
because she managed a deep understanding of the &quot;native's experience.&quot;</P>

<P>Later, I thought about my friend's simple explanation of fibromyalgia.
Why was it so meaningful to me that someone understood how I feel? At the
same time, however, I felt a little strange about it. As if my friend had
peered into the otherwise personal and private relationship between me and
my pain. I pondered my mixed emotional reaction.</P>

<P>I began to ask people with similar &quot;invisible&quot; conditions about
their desire to be understood. The answers were mainly practical: If we
were understood, they explained, we would not have such a difficult time
being excused from certain activities. Friends would understand why we were
saying &quot;no,&quot; and not push us. They would accommodate us, or give
us a break when we need it. The same goes for family, and even coworkers
when possible. In addition, being understood is important because it can
restore self esteem when we are not able to finish (or even start) the projects
we take on. Being &quot;ill&quot; is preferable to being thought of as &quot;lazy,&quot;
&quot;hypochondriacal,&quot; or a &quot;whiner.&quot; Finally, being understood,
particularly by someone who shares our experience, creates a feeling of
camaraderie. You do not have to explain in any detail to produce an accurate
picture or evoke an appropriate response. To be understood is to be validated.</P>

<P><B>What It Means to Be &quot;Understood&quot;</B></P>

<P>Many of us often think with dismay that &quot;nobody knows what we are
going through.&quot; This is probably correct. The casual observer is unlikely
to perceive the depth of our pain or fatigue through our behavior or appearance.
And our friends, try as they may, often feel confused by our seemingly strange
array of complaints. Our presentation communicates the double message of
&quot;invisible illness&quot; -- that we can look perfectly fine, but feel
absolutely crummy.</P>

<P>A few friends of mine with invisible illnesses, however, prefer the secrecy.
They would rather appear like everyone else and lick their wounds later,
in private. They have weighed the cost of added physical discomfort against
the biases they imagine people may have against them, their abilities, their
attractiveness, and even their value as a person, and decided to &quot;bite
the bullet.&quot; For them, understanding appears threatening, unless reserved
for their most intimate circle.</P>

<P>As such, understanding represents a two-edged sword. Let's think about
it. If someone <B>really</B> knew what you were experiencing, say, right
now, how might that person feel or react? How do you feel when you know
someone is suffering? Knowing the extent of our difficulties may frighten
others, depending on their own life experiences and how close they are to
us. Those closest to us, and particularly the more nurturing, may become
overprotective. They may wait on us hand and foot, as though we are unable
to do <B>anything</B> for ourselves.</P>

<P>At the same time, our social invitations may dwindle as &quot;understanding&quot;
friends protect us from overtaxing activities. And although there are laws
against discrimination, it is not difficult to imagine coworkers and bosses
changing their opinion about the type or amount of work suitable for people
like us (even if we had been successfully doing it!). Such &quot;understanding&quot;
could affect our ability to find and keep manageable employment.</P>

<P>It therefore seems to me that understanding, like many things, is something
that we want when it is convenient for us, but that we would like to withhold
when it works against us. Rather than providing full information with a
vivid stamp on our forehead (or something less abstract such as a wheelchair),
we may prefer to disclose information about our condition as we feel comfortable
to do so. We could offer limited, person-specific understandings rather
than a fuller picture of our situation. After all, wouldn't we prefer to
be invited to take part in the activities of life (and sometimes have to
say no, or leave early) than to be not invited at all? On days when we feel
better or have the gumption to push, we will want to join in! It is better
that this remains up to us.</P>

<P>What does it really mean to understand someone else's experience anyway?
Let's take a look around ourselves. What is going on with our friends, our
family, our colleagues? Can you really understand what your neighbor going
through a difficult divorce feels? What about your friend with an eating
disorder? You may not even be aware of it, or the extent to which it governs
her days. What about the couple you know who have been desperately trying
to have children, who are now participating in the impersonal, drawn-out
gamble with science in hopes of conceiving? What about friends who have
lost a spouse, a parent, or even a child? Can most of us say we understand?</P>

<P>More likely we are guilty of avoiding someone in one of these situations
because we do not know what to say or how to act. We probably feel badly
for them, and the thought of facing their problems makes us feel more uncomfortable.</P>

<P>I am not pointing this out to say that we are self-centered buffoons
for wanting understanding, while we ourselves are unable to understand others'
life experiences. Rather, I would like to suggest that (1) understanding
another person's experience is something rare, and (2) that sort of understanding
may not be crucial to being a good friend.</P>

<P>Unless you are going through a similar experience (and sometimes even
if you are), deep understanding of someone else's experience is difficult
to achieve. However, I also argue, it is not necessary to have first-hand
knowledge of what it is like to have lost a child, for example, to be a
good, supportive or loving friend to someone who has. But think how much
easier it would be if your friend provided guidelines about what helps the
most, and the areas that are most sensitive. Well, by knowing yourself and
accepting your current needs, this is precisely the sort of information
you can provide for your friends, to make their job as friends easier.</P>

<P><B>Self-Understanding Is Key</B></P>

<P>So rather than longing for understanding from others, the critical thing
may be to understand yourself and be able to communicate that picture to
others. How people will treat you is largely up to you -- and your behavior.
The more you are able to recognize your own capabilities and limits, know
your preferences, and are familiar with your audience, the better able you
will be to do this.</P>

<P>Recognizing your own capabilities and limits helps communicate to others
enough to receive an understanding response. While it is likely that your
abilities will slowly increase as you find ways to pace and adapt, it helps
to know what you are able to do right now. When unable to finish something
as planned, we may feel the hopelessness that often comes from struggling
with chronic illness. But healthy friends also complain about their own
slowness. &quot;That's not the same thing!&quot; you protest. And I agree,
in many ways it is not, and certainly not to us. But keep in mind that most
people have competing demands and often say &quot;no&quot; for all sorts
of reasons. This sometimes gets blurred by people with chronic illness who
are so eager to be able to say yes. Your &quot;no&quot; or &quot;not yet&quot;
is not viewed as harshly as you probably view it yourself.</P>

<P>Knowing your preferences makes it easier for everyone involved. The best
way, I have found, to figure out how various factors affect you is to keep
careful notes. Create a simple worksheet to record the most important variables
of each day and measures of your experience. As you become well informed
about the effects of say, noise, light, temperature, activities, movement,
and lack of movement, you are in a much better position to keep yourself
feeling better. The less control you have over your environment, the less
you can affect these things. But at least you can plan your day. If, for
example, you know the supermarket is always too cold and bright -- wear
extra clothes and always have a pair of sunglasses handy.</P>

<P><B>Plan Ahead</B></P>

<P>Know your audience enough to see what they need to know. While you would
not call ahead and ask your grocer to darken or heat the market, you certainly
can ask a worker to help load groceries in your car. If you do not want
to offer a long explanation, tell him you suffer from arthritis, a well
known and thus more acceptable condition. As for friends, it is up to you
how much you wish to reveal. For those you are the closest to, you could
offer written material (there is now so much out there!). Start with something
short, like a pamphlet. You may be surprised how much close friends and
family members may want to read about your condition. This not only provides
background on your condition, but has the legitimacy of science behind it.
Otherwise, it is up to you how (or if) you want to explain your own experience.
You may tell friends that you suffer from pain and fatigue, and that while
the symptoms fluctuate, your overall condition will not deteriorate. See
how they react. If they seem interested in helping, you could explain what
types of things affect you most, and the simple things your friends can
do to make your life much easier (such as opening heavy doors, lifting or
carrying heavy objects). Most friends will be happy to do the simple things
that can make a huge difference to your well-being. It is more complicated
with coworkers and casual acquaintances, with whom you may not want to share
intimate details of your life. But you do not have to. Reveal information
only when it becomes relevant. If you are lacking a good chair: you can
explain that you have back trouble and need a supportive chair. It is not
necessary to explain fibromyalgia to everyone. If a line is too long for
you to withstand, you could ask for a supervisor and explain that you have
a neuromuscular pain condition and need special consideration. Select an
explanation that fits the situation. Try to figure what you can comfortably
ask of people. Always keep your requests simple and show lots of appreciation
for any effort taken on your behalf.</P>

<P>Applying this at work may be the most difficult, where deadlines are
likely to be less flexible. Of course jobs vary significantly in this regard.
It is your call whether you want to share your disability with your employers.
But either way, your boss or clients do not need to learn the details of
your disability -- but just enough to accommodate you. You will have to
engage in a careful balancing act between trying to achieve the work environment
you need and not putting off people with fears that you are unable to do
the job. This makes knowing your abilities crucial. If you have a clear
idea of what it would take for you to do a job, and what you may need in
the form of special considerations, you can be straightforward. Not apologetic.
Not demanding. In most situations where you need special assistance (helpful
gadgets, rest breaks), your employer is legally obliged to accommodate you.
When you are comfortable with your own needs, it becomes much easier to
communicate them, and without self pity or bad feeling.</P>

<P>Applying this in social situations should be much easier. After all,
social engagements are supposed to be fun! While this sounds like an obvious
statement, how many times are we exhausted by spending time with our friends?
To some extent, this is inevitable. But we can play a hand in reducing the
stress of interaction, and increasing our pleasure and enjoyment. Because
we have limited energy, the first step is prioritizing: select the engagements
you want most to attend and decline those that are less important. For those
you will attend, think about what would make it easier for you? First, what
can <B>you</B> do to make yourself most comfortable? (My bag of tricks always
includes ear plugs, a heat sack and extra medications). Second, if you are
going to an event with others, what would you like <B>them</B> to know?
It may help, for example, to check whether the driver would mind leaving
somewhat early. Third, what can the host or hostess do to increase your
comfort? Call ahead and find out enough about the environment to help you
prepare. Then, if there is something that would make a significant difference,
explain it simply. For example: ask, &quot;if I am feeling bad, would it
be all right if I go into another room for a few minutes to lie down?&quot;
Creative backup plans can help you feel more comfortable about participating.
Remember, everyone would prefer that you feel good! If your request creates
only minor inconveniences for others, most people would be happy to pitch
in (especially if you show your appreciation.) Finally, leaving early also
keeps experiences more pleasant. As my grandfather always said, &quot;never
stay too long - it keeps people wanting more.&quot; And they always did!</P>
