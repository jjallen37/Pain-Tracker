<H2><CENTER>Witch or Martyr? How to Live with Others</CENTER></H2>

<P>One of the greatest challenges of chronic pain is finding ways
to live with others. Sometimes it seems more comforting to stay
home alone, where we can relax, tend to our aches, set our own
pace, and control our total environment. This would free us from
having to explain, apologize, look odd, or feel guilty about the
things we have difficulty contending with. We would no longer
impose our tortured bodies on anybody else.</P>

<P>This fantasy, however, has some major flaws! What does it mean
to have a life? Usually, living involves a variety of work, social
experiences, and travel that remove us from the cozy nest we try
to construct and put us in contact with the outside world. What
would it really mean to give this up? Without chronic illness,
few of us would consider a hermit's life even marginally appealing.
Now, we are pressed to find ways to maintain relationships --
precious relationships -- without excessive discomfort.</P>

<P>From a handshake with a new colleague to a long trip to visit
family, we constantly struggle to reduce physical stress without
burdening others or calling undue attention to our illness. These
issues are relevant for short interactions with acquaintances
as well as daily dealings with those most intimate to us. Finding
ways to express our special needs requires careful situation-specific
negotiations.</P>

<P>Most people want to be taken care of when they feel awful.
People with chronic problems, however, constantly appear needy.
This can be taxing to all parties involved. This article grapples
with how to tread the line between acting the part of a martyr
and the part of a witch -- therein lies the challenge.</P>

<P><B>Just Say No</B></P>

<P>The first rule of thumb: Eliminate all activities you do not
value and that do not require your participation. Even though
we may be &quot;sick all the time,&quot; there is nothing wrong
with declining invitations for health reasons. A polite, &quot;thanks
for the invitation, but I am not feeling up to it&quot; should
suffice. People cancel for many reasons. Excessive pain and fatigue
are reason enough! We experience substantial pain; why add to
it by enduring irritating people or activities? Reduce contact
with individuals who drain you rather than add pleasure to your
life. Think of yourself as an Brahmin: Reserve your precious energy
for only the most important tasks. Prioritize. When possible,
eliminate the &quot;I should...&quot; activities for the &quot;I
want to...&quot; variety. It is often well worth paying someone
to carry out strenuous chores, such as housecleaning and grocery
shopping, to free ourselves for more fulfilling activities.</P>

<P><B>Limit Your Involvement</B></P>

<P>When you can't &quot;just say no,&quot; limit the time you
spend on burdensome tasks. If you must attend a social or work-related
engagement, plan to arrive late and leave early. It is likely
you will have a better time, and in most cases, people will not
notice.</P>

<P><B>Come Prepared</B></P>

<P>For activities we choose to engage in, there are ways to make
them less stressful and more enjoyable. Always be a good scout.
Fill your car or bag with creature comforts. Extra medication,
heat packs, pillows, silk long johns, earplugs and sunglasses
can be real life savers. Once you determine for yourself what
works, keep a checklist handy when you are preparing to go out.
Think about the conditions of the place you are going: What is
the temperature? Are the chairs comfortable? How is the lighting?
Call ahead to inquire about the environment and whether any special
arrangements can be made.</P>

<P><B>Communicate Clearly</B></P>

<P>Why is this one so hard? We need to express our needs to others
in ways that are simple, direct and polite. Often people who care
about us want to help but do not know what to do. However, asking
for help is not a neutral act. By asking, we acknowledge weakness
and dependence. Therefore physical discomfort is not the only
factor in a decision to seek help or special treatment. As I see
it, we suffer not only from physical discomfort. We also mourn
for the things we can no longer do, and we fear standing out,
calling attention to ourselves because we cannot keep up with
others.</P>

<P>For these reasons, we need to weigh the importance of seeking
assistance. In some circumstances, &quot;passing for normal&quot;
might be worth a certain amount of suffering. This depends on
such things as our plans for the rest of the day, our closeness
to the people we are with, their disposition and familiarity with
our condition, and our estimate of the repercussions.</P>

<P>We may prefer the five minutes of pain brought on from shaking
hands with one person, for example, to having to explain personal
limitations to a stranger. These are the kind of choices only
we are in the position to make. While a simple, &quot;I'm sorry,
I cannot shake hands today...it's very nice to meet you,&quot;
might work quite well, we may not feel up to it. Long explanations
are never needed. A quick explanation such as, &quot;I hurt my
hand,&quot; accompanied with a warm smile is unlikely to set interactions
off kilter.</P>

<P>Asking for special assistance when something requires only
minor alterations from others but greatly affects our well-being
is the least difficult. Little requests such as opening jars or
carrying small packages across the street can even help others
feel good about themselves and their contribution to our comfort.</P>

<P>Difficulties may arise, however, when we desire substantial
changes by others, when our wishes are at odds with those of others,
or when we appear too aggressive. Asking for a sturdier chair
is not difficult, but asking everyone to move tables may be more
than is reasonable to ask. We cannot expect a party of twenty
to change plans on account of our situation. Likely, there are
others in the group with particular needs or preferences. In these
situations, it is most important to come as prepared as possible
with layers of clothes, earplugs, or whatever increases our comfort.
We can excuse ourselves as often as needed to meditate, stretch,
run hot water over our hands -- whatever helps.</P>

<P>Our requests should take into account our relationship with
the people, how familiar they are with our condition, and the
length of time the interaction will take. On one extreme, we may
decide to play the martyr -- to keep quiet and endure great pains
so as not to create a scene or disrupt others. However, most people
would prefer to make some sacrifices if it means saving you from
several days of down time. Put yourself in their place: how would
you feel if you could have prevented your friend from having to
spend two days in bed recovering? You would feel terrible, especially
if something as simple as meeting inside rather than outside could
have prevented it.</P>

<P>Although our pain may be quite intense, it is virtually invisible
to those around us. No red flag begins to waive when our condition
suddenly deteriorates. This makes communication paramount. Because
of the intensity of our pain, we may (rightly) feel entitled to
preferential treatment. But remember, others do not see our suffering:
Few of us consistently use wheelchairs or other assistive devices
 that elicit sympathetic reactions. The most direct route is a
simple explanation that we have a chronic pain condition which
is greatly affected by certain factors, followed by a polite request.
If your request is granted, make sure to express your appreciation.</P>

<P>The way we ask makes a difference. In the United States, helping
others is considered an act of charity, not something expected
of us. If we demand special accommodations in a bossy manner (the
witch), people will be less enthusiastic about helping. But if
we focus instead on how much we appreciate their assistance, others
will likely oblige.</P>

<P><B>Preferences Versus Needs</B></P>

<P>Many people have strong preferences. With us, however, our
&quot;preferences&quot; are often &quot;needs&quot; that, if not
met, they cost us dearly. The onset of out-of-control pain or
fatigue is frightening and potentially embarrassing, enough to
make us wish we stayed home.</P>

<P>Because many aspects of daily interactions create additional
difficulties for us, it is completely reasonable to try to influence
the environment to suit us better. When it comes to pain, we are
no longer contending only with &quot;preferences.&quot; We would
probably have shared others' preferences (for nice long walks,
convertibles, etc.) had our physical condition not turned otherwise
joyful events into hardships.</P>

<P>But while our condition may be severe, everyone has preferences
and people vary in their flexibility. It is unrealistic to assume
we alone experience ailments. When asking for help, show respect
for others and inquire about how the change may affect them. Many
people, for example, suffer from back trouble. On an airplane,
you might inquire of a sturdy-looking young man: &quot;Because
I suffer from a muscle condition, I cannot lift my bag into the
compartment, could you help me?&quot; In most cases, strangers
are happy to lend a hand (and our bags are surprisingly light).</P>

<P>The more complicated situation involves those with whom we
are closest. For those most intimate, it's extremely important
to understand what makes us feel better or worse. They certainly
don't want us to suffer more! However, these are the people most
affected by our suffering. When asking of them, do not dwell on
your needs and always express gratitude when someone arranges
something for you without your asking.</P>

<P>No doubt close friends will want to help you prevent additional
pain. At the same time, even the most sympathetic people may begin
to resent numerous constraints on their behavior. It is very important
to determine their boundaries. Some people have endless tolerance
and patience; while others are easily frustrated by the pertinacity
of our condition.</P>

<P>Although we may have to contend with continual pain, it is
not fair to use it as a trump card so that our preferences automatically
come first. Although the kindness of friends may save us days
of pain, we should not make others feel responsible or guilty
about our suffering.</P>

<P>Relationships require balance: they are not a one-way street.
Remember to keep abreast of the needs of those close to you and
try your best to accommodate them. Framing your requests as special
favors, rather than expectations, may allay any negative feelings.</P>

<P><B>Identifying Our Needs</B></P>

<P>On a practical level, know what you need -- the type of chair,
lighting, temperature, rest breaks, and noise level -- to be most
comfortable. This makes it easier both for yourself and for those
who want to lend a hand. Although the variety of things that affect
us may become intuitive to us, they likely seem an odd assortment
of factors to others. Help them by being very clear about what
is most difficult and helpful to you. Be simple: &quot;I have
a lot of trouble with _________, it would be super if you could
___________. Will this be a problem?&quot;</P>

<P><B>Overidentification (Too Much Empathy)</B></P>

<P>Sometimes our loved ones have the most difficulty confronting
our disabilities. Our suffering is hardest on those who care most.
For them, our difficulties become theirs, sometimes resulting
in psychosomatic, empathic reactions. While we may want to share
all of our experiences with them, think about the effect this
may have. How would you feel if your partner or child were in
terrible pain all the time? Just as we crave a break from our
symptoms, our family and friends need relief from thinking about
them. This does not mean we should be martyrs; your goal should
be to create a balance between sharing our trouble and focusing
on other things. Be sure to introduce topics unrelated to your
medical state. Distraction can be extremely helpful. How much
fun can it be to spend time with someone always focused exclusively
on their illness? Stockpile interesting stories to share that
will take everyone's mind off your day-to-day problems and focus
on more interesting subjects. On the other hand, it is important
to keep your family and friends generally informed about your
well-being so that they can know what to expect. It may be helpful
to devise a system to signify pivotal points where assistance
means a lot. Some people feel helpless if they are not actively
assisting you: for them, find discrete tasks they are comfortable
with. Others, however, feel overburdened by simple requests. People
vary in their tolerance for suffering, both for their own and
for that of other people.</P>

<P>Just because we may suffer does not mean our partners or family
should also. We can reduce their discomfort by trying to prevent
situations where our pain gets out of control. Taking good care
of ourselves also helps them. Try to focus on the gratifying events
of each day. Helping a partner stay in good spirits contributes
to a more positive state of mind for us as well.</P>

<P><B>Denial</B></P>

<P>Some people close to us may be reluctant to offer help because
they may not want to accept we have a &quot;real problem.&quot;
Some may be skeptical because there are no &quot;objective&quot;
indicators of our illness; the medical community is still somewhat
disbelieving. For these people, education is the key. Literature
now abounds about many aspects of fibromyalgia, from symptoms,
to coping strategies, to assistance for families and loved ones.
Because of the wide variety of our symptoms and needs, one approach
is to admit that our condition is rather bizarre. In making a
request, you may say, for example, &quot;I know this seems odd,
but the noise from your open car window actually creates tension
in my muscles that causes terrible pain.&quot;</P>

<P>Those afraid to admit that we may be ill need reassurance that,
although we have a medical problem, we will still be available
for them. Children may be afraid to confront their parents' vulnerability.
Feeding their denial, however, forces you to adopt a martyr role.
Those who care about you can be reassured that you can control
this benign illness with certain procedures with which they can
help, if they so desire. This does not mean you will become dependent
on them. To the contrary, the more others help with the little
things, the more available you will be for them. Remember what
the airlines always say before takeoff about putting on the air
mask in the event of emergency? &quot;First secure your own mask,
then help those around you with theirs.&quot;</P>

<P>In sum, interactions with the outside world can be challenging
when you are dealing with chronic pain and fatigue. To preserve
energy for the things most important to you, eliminate all superfluous
tasks and unpleasant social activity. For those activities we
choose to do, always come prepared. When we desire assistance
from others, ask politely and clearly, explaining that they are
saving us a great deal of pain and we are very grateful. People
like to feel appreciated. When this approach is unsuccessful,
there are several options. We may decide to rule out future interactions
of this sort when possible. We can calculate whether the extra
pain is worth it. We are the toughest group around. But playing
the martyr entails huge costs and can be done only so much. When
it comes to those closest to us, clear communication is crucial.
You should make sure others understand your needs. But, at the
same time, you should respect their preferences too. Living with
someone who is chronically ill is taxing. Make sure to give credit
to those who stick by us. We have many thorns in our feet. It's
the greatest act of love to pull one out. By finding ways to communicate
with our family, friends and colleagues, we can pull the thorns
out together, one by one.</P>
