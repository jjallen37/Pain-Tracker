<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>Improving through Fitness</H2>

<P>A doctor who has fibromyalgia once told me: &quot;You can have weak muscles
that hurt, or strong muscles that hurt.&quot; This statement made a big
impression on me. Although exercise will not cure the pain and exhaustion
of fibromyalgia, muscle endurance increases our capabilities. The message
in the medical literature is clear: people with fibromyalgia who are physically
fit suffer less symptoms. The key question is how we get there. How can
we get in shape when it hurts just to get out of bed? The answer, like most
aspects of dealing with this condition, is not simple. It requires discipline,
faith, and lots of patience. But sticking to a personalized exercise program
can really pay off.</P>

<P>When I first read about the helpfulness of exercise, I literally tried
to exercise the fibromyalgia right out of me. While bouncing on the StairMaster,
I felt no pain. Endorphins made me feel terrific and invincible. Hours afterward,
however, the pain was excruciating. My life became divided between intense
workouts and sheer agony. No surprise -- I soon stopped exercising altogether.</P>

<P>I now understand the importance of working with the body I have, not
one I wish I had or have had in the past. The adage, &quot;listen to your
body,&quot; cannot be overstated with fibromyalgia. We need to proceed like
a tortoise: slow and steady. And, like the tortoise, we too will reach the
finishing line. Slowly and steadily, I built up to a one-hour cardiovascular
workout, and a strengthening routine on Nautilus machines. I am stronger,
both physically and psychologically, and have much greater stamina in daily
activities. Over the years, my routine has been interrupted by the flu,
a car accident, or other unplanned event. Each time, I found the level where
I could exercise comfortably when I was again ready and built back up slowly.
At times I have had to adjust the type of exercise as well. When a lower-back
injury kept me from walking for months, I adopted a water program. However
carefully we live our lives, such setbacks occur. The resiliency of our
bodies, however slow, inspires confidence.</P>

<P>Your exercise routine should be devised under the supervision of a doctor
and a physical therapist who are knowledgeable about fibromyalgia. Because
you are the one familiar with your daily symptoms, you need to take the
most active role in adjusting your program. Here's what I found (the hard
way) to be the central points of a successful exercise regime.</P>

<P><B>A Daily Report Sheet</B></P>

<P>As I emphasize over and over, a worksheet is critical to figure out how
to proceed. Create a personalized worksheet to monitor your exercise and
your reactions to it. It is helpful to include other factors that may affect
how you feel, such as the amount and quality of your sleep; any changes
in medication; weather conditions; activities; and stress levels. Careful
daily records make it possible to gauge progress. When pain is bad, it is
very hard not to become discouraged. But recorded evidence of long-term
improvement is quite inspiring. Review your report sheets frequently to
understand your body's response to your program. The golden rule is to moderate
your activity so you can exercise again two days later. If you hurt too
much, cut back! Those who have not been active for some time should start
very slowly. Try something minimal, like walking on a treadmill for less
than one minute. In 1995, I started with just 30 seconds because walking
irritated my hips and shoulders. As my tolerance grew, I was able to increase,
first by 30-second intervals, then by several minutes. By 1997, I was walking
easily more than four miles up a ten-degree incline! It also helps if you
have a friend with whom you can share your improvements, someone to call
and say, &quot;Guess what? I walked one and a half miles today and feel
OK!&quot; If you have a buddy who can join you for workouts, even better!</P>

<P><B>Pain-Relieving Modalities</B></P>

<P>Exercise can cause muscle soreness; and for us this is an understatement!
Therefore, you need to have a full array of methods to make yourself feel
better and keep going. I always end my workout by relaxing in a sauna. Massage
helps some people tremendously. Strong muscle relaxants and analgesics,
a TENS units, and heat packs can also make a big difference. A leisurely
hot bath with candles, earplugs, and baby oil may bring any sort of day
to a pleasant close. Always keep in mind that although our muscles may hurt
like hell, using them will not injure them. Post-exercise soreness will
decrease over time, especially if you respond to your body's signals and
pace yourself. No doubt it will be hardest in the beginning, so stockpile
your most effective modalities to keep your levels of pain and fatigue tolerable.</P>

<P><B>Physical Fitness Program</B></P>

<P>Whether you decide to join a gym, participate in a class, or develop
a home routine, there are three components of a thorough exercise program:
cardiovascular fitness, strengthening, and stretching.</P>

<P><B>Cardiovascular exercise. </B>Choose an aerobic exercise you enjoy,
perhaps something you are already doing. Some like using an Aqua Jogger
in a warm pool, yoga, or dancing to music at home. I like the treadmill
because it is easy to track the intensity of my workout and because I wanted
to increase my ability to walk distances. What's important is that you choose
something easy to do on a regular basis. Make it something you look forward
to, not dread. Listen to books on tape or your favorite music, or use the
time for reflection. For exercise to be aerobic, you needn't be out of breath.
According to the American College of Sports Medicine, the training effect
of aerobic exercise takes place between 60% and 90% of your maximum heart
rate (calculated as 220 minus your age). So if you are 30 years old, for
example, aerobic exercise begins when your pulse reaches 114 beats per minute.
(At 40, it begins at 108; at 50, 102; and so on).</P>

<P><B>Strength-building exercise.</B> Guidance from a physical therapist
who understands your needs is particularly helpful in devising a strengthening
routine. Strengthening exercises can include pushups, lifting cans of corn,
or stretching those colorful, rubbery physical-therapy bands. If you decide
to join a gym, make sure whoever assists you knows about your condition
and the importance of light weights and gradual increases. If you begin
with something extremely minimal you can do it daily. As you increase, give
your body a day or two of rest in between. Try to ignore the bodybuilders
around you. The only comparison that matters is how you are doing over time.
My first day, I tried several Nautilus machines with no extra weight (I
removed the pin) and lifted the weight one time. As I discovered the effect
of each machine on my various muscle groups, I increased accordingly. I
now do several repetitions on ten machines, lifting as much as forty pounds
on some. With others I have kept the lowest setting and increased the number
of repetitions. Keep track of and celebrate your progress!</P>

<P>There are also endless exercises you can at home do to build up important
muscles. For example, the staircase offers a great way to build up to doing
pushups. &quot;Push ups!&quot; you protest. Yes, push ups. But not lying
prone and grunting out many sets. Begin with just one. Stand at the base
of your stairs and arrange yourself to do one push up on the step around
chest level. Remember, just one. If your arms, shoulders, and back do not
feel any worse for wear the following day, try another. If you do not have
a staircase at home, you can use other sturdy objects such as a table or
bed at comfortable gradients. Over time slowly increase the number of pushups.
When you feel you have mastered that level, add one push up with your arms
one step lower. Build up again. Eventually you may be doing floor pushups
and feeling very proud of yourself.</P>

<P><B>Stretching. </B>Exercise causes muscles to contract. Through stretching,
you want your muscles to achieve a nice, elongated state. Never stretch
cold muscles. Good places to stretch are first thing in the morning while
under a warm comforter. Or better yet, in a hot shower, a sauna or hot tub,
or after a hot bath. Exercise also warms up your muscles. To get the most
out of a stretch, you must relax. Breathe slowly and deeply through your
diaphragm. (Fill your belly, not your chest.) Do not push yourself, as you
can 'pull' or injure a muscle. As you exhale let your muscle gently stretch
to a comfortable point. Breathe slowly and relax into the stretch. Hold
the muscle in place as long as it feels good, up to a minute. As you exhale,
try to stretch a little harder. Relax and hold it there. Never stretch or
hold a muscle past a level of comfort. Stretching after exercise decreases
the likelihood of soreness.</P>

<H4>A Final Note</H4>

<P>Each of us is different. Our abilities depend on our age, our past level
of fitness, and the severity of our symptoms. But whatever your condition,
a moderated exercise program can make you feel better. In the worst case,
you will be stronger, in better shape, and look better ... and still hurt.
Most likely, however, physical fitness will decrease your pain and increase
your abilities. It has for me.</P>
