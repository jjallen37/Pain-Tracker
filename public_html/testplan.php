            <p>
                There are two parts to the test plan:
                the first is what you would do if you had all the time that you really needed
                and the second is what you are actually going to test.
            </p>
            <p>
                While a general test plan would cover unit, system and usability testing
                and answer questions about tools and types of users,
                you should limit your document (both parts) to system testing.
                Consider different test environments, error conditions and data-specific test cases.
                Also consider the types of users that need to test the system.
            </p>
            <p>
                Recognize that the second part is my guide to testing.
                Anything that you claim is tested is fair game.
                This is to be very concrete and specific.
                I want to see who you are asking to test the system and when they will test it.
                I also want precise environemts you will test it in, including versions of software.
