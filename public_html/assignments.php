	    <p>
		Each team is to give a 30-45 minute presentation on a technology that they are
		using in their project.
		The 30-minute limit will be STRICTLY enforced.
		Tere will either be one or two presentations in a class period.
		Your presentation should explaining the technology,
		why it is important and interesting, and what are the most applicable uses.
		Include information about what problem it is solving and what technologies,
		if any, it is built on and are replacing.
	    </p>
	    <h3>Topics</h3>
	    <p>
		The topic of the presentation may be a language, library, framework or platform.
		The scope may be the complete technology or a particular aspect of it.
		For example, there are a lot of different and interesting aspects about
		the Android SDK or HTML5 and 
		it would be appropriate to cover only a specific piece.
		Here is a list of possible topics.
		It includes many that I know teams are already using,
		but it does include others as well.
		They are in no special order.
		<ul class="nobullet">
		  <li>Hadoop</li>
		  <li>MangoDB (or another noSQL database)</li>
		  <li>GWT (Google Web Toolkit)</li>
		  <li>Xcode</li>
		  <li>QT</li>
		  <li>Phonegap</li>
		  <li>Sencha</li>
		  <li>Dojo</li>
		  <li>Zend</li>
		  <li>JQuery Mobile</li>
		  <li>Struts</li>

		</ul>
	    </p>
	    <h3>Presentations</h3>
	    <p>
		You should be ready to answer questions from the class.
		My hope is that the presentation will engender a discussion about
		the value and importance of the technology.
		The presentation is expected to engage the class as well as teach the material.
		You will be graded on both style and content.
		Grading will take into account my evaluation of whether the class is
		absorbing the information.
	    </p>
	    <p>
		All members of the team MUST present.
		Presentation must include visuals of some form:
		presentation, web sites, demos are all acceptable.
		If you choose to use a video, it must be short and to the point.
		Reference material for the class must be provided;
		this may be part of the presentation material.
	    </p>
	    <h3>Preparation</h3>
	    <p>
		Each team will review their presentation with me at the
		regularly scheduled team meeting preceding the presentation.
		At that time, I expect a clear outline of what will be
		discussed and who will be presenting the material.
		I prefer to have visuals available at that time as well.
	    </p>
	    <h3>Due: September 21</h3>
	    <p>
		All that is due today is the topic that you would like to cover.
		Please give me a prioritized list of the topics that you would
		like to cover.
		I will expect a single email from each team.
		I will make the assignments, including dates, over the weekend;
		note that dates are subject to change as I schedule outside speakers.
